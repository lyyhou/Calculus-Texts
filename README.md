# Calculus-Texts
study aids for the calculus of functions of a single variable. They may provide simple insight, new ideas, and a different perspective to concepts that traditionally are taught fairly similarly. I may provide analysis definitions such as delta epsilon in order to achieve a better understanding, *no tutorials on differentiation and integration yet*
The structure (once completed) will follow: 
Limits & Differentiation
Integration
Infinite Series 
Infinite Series Applications
Calculus of Polar Coordinates
Calculus of Two Dimensional Vectors
